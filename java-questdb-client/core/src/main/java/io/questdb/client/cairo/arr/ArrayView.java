/**
 * This class represents a flat array of numbers with a hierarchical addressing
 * scheme applied to it, which makes it usable as an N-dimensional array accessed
 * with N indexes. For example, here's a 4x3x2 array:
 * <pre>
 * {
 *     { {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6} },
 *     { {7, 8}, {9, 0}, {1, 2} },
 *     { {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8} },
 *     { {9, 0}, {1, 2}, {3, 4} }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Its backing flat array looks like this:
 * <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</code>.
 * <p>
 * Hierarchical subdivision of the flat array, this example uses a 2x3x2 array (dots
 * represent elements, bars demarcate array slots):
 * <pre>
 * dim 0: |. . . . . .|. . . . . .| -- stride = 6, len = 2
 * dim 1: |. .|. .|. .|. .|. .|. .| -- stride = 2, len = 3
 * dim 2: |.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.| -- stride = 1, len = 2
 * </pre>
 * Formula to access a member with syntax `arr[i,j,k]`:
 * <pre>
 *     flatIndex = 6i + 2j + k
 * </pre>
 * Note that this just sums up the contributions at each dimension. We can perform
 * it in any order.
 *
 * <h2>Transpose</h2>
 * <p>
 * Transposing the array changes the formula so that we apply the strides in
 * reverse:
 * <pre>
 *     flatIndex = i + 2j + 6k
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In fact, we can order the dimensions any way we want -- it's all linear and the
 * order doesn't matter to the calculation. It only affects the meaning of each
 * coordinate in the array access expression.
 *
 * <h2>Slice</h2>
 * <p>
 * Slicing the array means limiting the range of an index. Example: `arr[1:2]`.
 * This constrains index `i` to be at least 1. But, we don't expose that to the
 * user; instead we keep the index zero-based, and add the lower bound to it as a
 * constant:
 * <pre>
 *     flatIndex = 6(1 + i) + 2j + k
 * </pre>
 * Now we can extract the constant:
 * <pre>
 *     flatIndex = 6 + 6i + 2j + k
 *     flatIndex = flatOffset + 6i + 2j + k
 * </pre>
 * And this is the full formula we use in the code. If we perform another slicing
 * on top of this, we get another constant, and add it to the existing
 * <i>flatOffset</i>.
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> We use zero-based indexes here, but SQL uses one-based
 * array indexes!
 *
 * <h2>Flatten a Dimension</h2>
 * <p>
 * Flattening means eliminating a dimension from our addressing scheme. As an
 * example, let's flatten the dimension 0, but we can do it for any dimension
 * except the lowest one (with stride = 1). We'll be left with this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * dim 1: |. .|. .|. .|. .|. .|. .| -- stride = 2, len = 6
 * dim 2: |.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.| -- stride = 1, len = 2
 * </pre>
 * We can see the strides stayed the same, but we had to make the dimension 1
 * longer. We had to multiply its previous length by the length of the removed
 * dimension.
 * <p>
 * This will work regardless of the order of dimensions -- just find the dimension
 * with the next-finer stride and modify its length!
 * <p>
 * Our code only inspects the two neighboring dimensions, and chooses the one with
 * the finer stride. This is OK because we use either the "regular" dimension order
 * ("row-major" -- strides in descending order), or the "transposed" order
 * ("column-major", strides in ascending order), so the next-finer stride must be in
 * one of the neighboring dimensions.
 *
 * <h2>Take a Sub-Array</h2>
 * <p>
 * We can take a sub-array on any dimension. Examples for a 3D-array:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><code>arr[0]</code> removes the first dimension, and returns the 2D
 *          sub-array at index 0 of the removed dimension.
 *     <li><code>arr[0:, 1]</code> removes the middle dimension, taking, for each of
 *          the outer indices, the array at index 1 in the middle dimension, and returns
 *          the resulting 2D sub-array.
 * </ul>
 * Taking a sub-array is a composition of two operations: first slice it to a
 * single element in that dimension, then flatten the dimension. Because the
 * only allowed index at the dimension is 0 after slicing, we don't need to perform
 * a general flattening, we can simply remove the dimension without adjusting the
 * length of any other dimension. For the same reason, while general flattening is
 * not allowed on the dimension with stride 1, in this special case it is fine.
